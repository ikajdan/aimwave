# AimWave

AimWave is a simple 3D first-person shooter developed in Unity. In this game, players shoot targets to score points within a 30-second time limit, aiming to achieve the highest possible score before time runs out.

## User Interface

The game has a simple HUD that displays the score, time left and the ammo count.

## Controls

To control the game, the player can use the mouse to aim the gun and move the character using the `W`, `A`, `S`, and `D` keys. Shooting is triggered by pressing the `Left Mouse Button`. Reloading the gun is done by pressing the `R` key. The game begins with a press of the `Space` key. Pressing `Esc` quits the game immediately.

The following table lists the controls in the game:

| Action       | Key                |
|--------------|--------------------|
| Aim          | Move Mouse         |
| Move         | W, A, S, D         |
| Shoot        | Left Mouse Button  |
| Reload       | R                  |
| Start Game   | Space              |
| Exit Game    | Esc                |

## Game Mechanics

The game features a simple scoring system, granting 1 point for each target hit. Targets randomly appear along the walls facing the player, and must be shot to score. Each wall has 3 targets, and to make them reappear, all 3 must be destroyed. The next set of targets will spawn after a brief delay. The game ends when the 30-second timer runs out. Players can reload their gun at any moment, though the weapon can only hold 10 bullets at a time.
